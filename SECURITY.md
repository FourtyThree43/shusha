# 🌋 Security Policy - The Ring's Defense Protocol

## 🚨 Reporting a Dark Artifact

Hark, valiant traveler! If you come upon a dark artifact (security vulnerability), send a raven to [mail](mailto:shaqmwa@outlook.com). But beware, do not reveal its presence in the public scrolls of GitHub.

When informing us of the dark artifact, include the following details:

- **Tale of the Dark Artifact:**
  Narrate the dark tale of the security vulnerability you've stumbled upon.

- **Path to Mordor:**
  Map the treacherous journey to reproduce the security flaw.

- **Shadow-affected Versions:**
  Reveal which versions of our realm are tainted by the shadow.

- **Impact on Middle-earth:**
  Gauge the impact of this dark artifact on the harmony of Middle-earth.

## 💼 Security Response Process - The Fellowship's Pledge

Expect swift action from the Fellowship of Developers. Here's our pledge:

1. **Fellowship's Council:**
   Our Fellowship will convene to assess the threat level of the dark artifact.

2. **One Ring to Confirm Them All:**
   If the dark artifact is confirmed, we'll prioritize its destruction based on its malevolence.

3. **Crafting the Elessar Stone:**
   Our elven developers will forge an Elessar Stone (fix) to dispel the shadow.

4. **Gondor's Beacon and the Victory Horn:**
   Once the Elessar Stone is ready, we shall light Gondor's beacon (notify you) and celebrate with a victory horn. You will be honored in the scrolls of Middle-earth unless you prefer to remain a humble hobbit.

## 🚀 Supported Realms
